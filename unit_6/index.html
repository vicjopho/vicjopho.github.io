					<h2>Engagement Enchilada</h2>
					<p>If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain. If you´re not into yoga, if you have half a brain. If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape. I´m the love that you´ve looked for, write to me, and escape</p>

					<h2>Portrait Power</h2>
					<p>My love, there's only you in my life. The only thing that's bright. My first love, You're every breath that I take. You're every step I make. And I, I want to share. All my love with you. No one else will do. And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes</p>

					<h2>Event Envy</h2>
					<p>People are people and so why should it be, you and I should get along so awfully. So we're different colors. And we're different creeds. And different people have different needs. It's obvious you hate me.</p>

					<h2>I shoot, therefore I am</h2>
					<p>I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion. Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion. My fault, my failure, is not in the passions I have, but in my lack of control of them. Maybe that's what life is... a wink of the eye and winking stars. Our battered suitcases were piled on the sidewalk again; we had longer ways to go. But no matter, the road is life. All human beings are also dream beings. Dreaming ties all mankind together. My witness is the empty sky. A pain stabbed my heart, as it did every time I saw a girl I loved who was going the opposite direction in this too-big world. I hope it is true that a man can die and yet not only live in others but give them life, and not only life, but that great consciousness of life. All of life is a foreign country.</p>
